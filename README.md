# Smart-Voice-Calculator
A Python-based calculator that accepts voice commands to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It uses speech recognition to take input, processes the command using simple NLP, and speaks out the result through text-to-speech — all wrapped in an intuitive GUI.
